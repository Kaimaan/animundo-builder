# Task log

What ran for each task, and where the evidence is. Newest first.
Job folders live under `jobs/` (local only, never committed).

## 2026-10-27: inbox #3, arm's-length reviewer (T16 fix)

- Reviewer compares the render against the sheet part by part and
  frame by frame; a clean review after blocking issues is verified
  by a second look before it counts. New birds start from
  `great_tit.json`, scaled. The loop reads its models verdict from
  the world's draft checker, this species' problems only.
- Evidence: `jobs/eagle-r2/` (re-run with the fixed reviewer).

## 2026-10-27: inbox #1, #2, draft checker

- Region, species-plan healing and animals stages read the world's
  `check_draft.py` verdicts; the JSON lands in `checks/` and in the
  build report. The animals/models verdicts still fail on the
  world's own unbuilt models, so stages report but never gate on
  them; the models stage keeps its species filter.

## 2026-10-27: T33, Baseten serves the live builder

- All chat runs on Muse Spark Open with
  `BUILDER_OPEN_MODEL_HOST=baseten`; search, images and SAM stay on
  Meta. Own $100 pool, warn below $20, fallback inside the Meta
  caps. Proved live: a translation, a review-shaped call, and a
  real eagle review ($0.024, 7 issues where Meta passed the round).

## 2026-10-27: T38, build report

- `builder report <job>` writes a self-contained `report.html`:
  stages, cost, sources, checks, sheets, masks, round previews,
  review notes. Evidence: `jobs/eagle-demo/report.html`.

## 2026-10-26/27: T15, T16, model loop

- Spec T15/T16 names the red deer; the demo species is the golden
  eagle instead (test area `xx_eagle`, hand-seeded survey).
- 3 rounds to zero blocking issues, $0.64 over 22 calls.
- Evidence: `jobs/eagle-demo/`: `references/` (2 sheets, 4 masks),
  `rounds/` (spec, build log, preview each), `reviews/`,
  `models/` (final spec, `.glb`, preview), `log.jsonl`.
