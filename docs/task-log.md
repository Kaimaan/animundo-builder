# Task log

What ran for each task, and where the evidence is. Newest first.
Job folders live under `jobs/` (local only, never committed).

## 2026-10-27: inbox #3, arm's-length reviewer (T16 fix)

- Reviewer compares the render against the sheet part by part and
  frame by frame; a clean review after blocking issues is verified
  by a second look before it counts. New birds start from
  `great_tit.json`, scaled. The loop reads its models verdict from
  the world's draft checker, this species' problems only. A build
  that fails with no output stops at once instead of burning
  rounds.
- Attempt 1 (`jobs/eagle-r2/`, $0.22) died in the sandbox: Blender
  5.2.3 crashes in Metal detection under it, so all 6 rounds failed
  before review.
- Attempt 2 ($0.53) built and reviewed all 6 rounds but never
  converged: the fly bar ("level and off the ground") is higher
  than the builder can reach (the game's own great tit flies low
  and tipped), and the writer drifted `fly_pitch` 45 to 68 chasing
  it. Fixed the bar to the achievable look, pinned the pose keys
  in the spec prompt, softened the re-raise.
- Attempt 3 ($0.63 over 16 calls, incl. two API-timeout resumes)
  ran all 6 rounds with a new failure mode: identical issues every
  round, with fixes landing but overshooting (beak tiny to huge,
  tail stick to detached slabs) while the reviewer repeated R1
  wording verbatim ("beak tiny" over a giant beak). Two causes:
  the fixer never saw its own build, and the old issues in the
  review prompt anchored re-raises. Fix prompt now includes the
  previous preview; the review judges blind, with the re-verify
  follow-up keeping the old-issue check.
- Evidence: `jobs/eagle-r2/` (re-run with the fixed reviewer).

## 2026-10-27: inbox #1, #2, draft checker

- Region, species-plan healing and animals stages read the world's
  `check_draft.py` verdicts; the JSON lands in `checks/` and in the
  build report. The animals/models verdicts still fail on the
  world's own unbuilt models, so stages report but never gate on
  them; the models stage keeps its species filter.

## 2026-10-27: T33, Baseten serves the live builder

- All chat runs on Muse Spark Open with
  `BUILDER_OPEN_MODEL_HOST=baseten`; search, images and SAM stay on
  Meta. Own $100 pool, warn below $20, fallback inside the Meta
  caps. Proved live: a translation, a review-shaped call, and a
  real eagle review ($0.024, 7 issues where Meta passed the round).

## 2026-10-27: T38, build report

- `builder report <job>` writes a self-contained `report.html`:
  stages, cost, sources, checks, sheets, masks, round previews,
  review notes. Evidence: `jobs/eagle-demo/report.html`.

## 2026-10-26/27: T15, T16, model loop

- Spec T15/T16 names the red deer; the demo species is the golden
  eagle instead (test area `xx_eagle`, hand-seeded survey).
- 3 rounds to zero blocking issues, $0.64 over 22 calls.
- Evidence: `jobs/eagle-demo/`: `references/` (2 sheets, 4 masks),
  `rounds/` (spec, build log, preview each), `reviews/`,
  `models/` (final spec, `.glb`, preview), `log.jsonl`.

## 2026-10-27: inbox #5, #7, #8 (game-animals bar, deer next)

- #5 done: models verdict feeds back ALL world `problems`
  (existing models too — they are known to work, and the world
  may rebuild them first). `builder/stages/models.py`,
  `tests/test_models.py::test_models_final_verdict_problems`.
- #7 done: fly rule judges attitude in frame and height vs the
  rendered backdrop ("never by height alone"); fly pose keys
  pinned. `prompts/model_review_bird*.md`, `model_reverify.md`.
- #8 in code: kind-aware review prompts — game animals'
  previews (`moose.png`, `great_tit.png`) are the bar figure;
  bird prompts keep the fly rule, mammal prompts ground-more.
  Mammals anchor to the moose with the reviewed eagle as
  second anchor (`CLOSEST` order moose, eagle). Evidence:
  `tests/test_models.py` (anchors, per-kind fly rule, silent
  runs), `jobs/deer-demo/` seeded but not run.
- `builder report` now shows the final preview next to the
  game's closest animal (`tests/test_report.py`).

## 2026-10-27: T14 animal stage vs the real world

- Live run for one species (red deer, scratch job `jobs/t14-deer/`,
  gitignored): locale/schema/taxa/region/models verdicts pass;
  the only animals-verdict problem is the deer's own missing
  model, which the models stage builds later.
- Bug found live: a missing-model complaint naming a NEW species
  was routed back as a fixable problem and burned all 6 rounds
  ($0.17). The skip now runs before owner routing.
  `tests/test_animals.py::test_new_species_missing_model_is_ignored`.
- English text reads naturally; final `reads well` verdict is Kai's:
  `jobs/t14-deer/animals/red_deer.json`.
